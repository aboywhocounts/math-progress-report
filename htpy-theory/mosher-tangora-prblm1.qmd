In this post I'd like to post a solution to exerices 12.1 from Mosher and Tangora's *Cohomology Operations and Applications in Homotopy Theory*. This problem took me a lot of time to work out, but I think it's important to know how to do, so I've decided to make a post about it.

I should mention before starting that whenever $\pi_i^S(-)$ appears, I mean the **2-component** of the stable homotopy group. Additionally, much of the notation and terminology used here is from Mosher and Tangora's book, but I'll try and indicate when I'm using something specific from there. Also, I will denote the stable homotopy groups of spheres by $\pi_*^S$ for brevity.

The problem:

:::{#prob-mt1}
Let $M_n=S^n \cup_{2} e^{n+1}$. We can also think of this as $\S^{n-1}\RP^2$,  the $(n-1)$-suspension of the real projective plane. Compute the homotopy groups $\pi_{n+k}(M_n)$ for large $n$ and small $k$.

So there are two methods that I will pursue here: one is using the induced homotopy long exact sequence coming from the cofiber sequence 
$$ 
S^n\lrarrow S^n \lrarrow M_n 
$$
where the first arrow is the degree 2 map, and the second will be using the Serre spectral sequence in the style of chapter 12 of Mosher and Tangora's book. 

Let's begin with the cofiber sequence. Now, since $\pi_*^S$ is a generalized homology theory, the cofiber sequence above induces a long exact sequence in stable homotopy groups:
$$
\cdots \lrarrow \pi_n^S \xrightarrow{2} \pi_n^S \to \pi_n^S(M_n) \to \pi_{n-1}^S \xrightarrow{2} \pi_{n-1}^S\lrarrow \cdots 
$$

examining the bottom portion of this long exact sequence, we have 
$$
\pi_2^S \xrightarrow{2} \pi_2^S \to \pi_2^S(M_n) \to \pi_1^S \xrightarrow{2} \pi_1^S
$$

As we can see, $\pi^S_0(M_n)$ is the cokernel of the degree 2 map on $\pi_0^S(S^n) \cong \Z$, which is $\Z/2\Z$, and so $\pi^S_0(M_n) \cong \Z/2\Z$. Now, since multiplication by 2 is injective on $\pi_1^S\cong \Z$, we know that the map $\pi_1^S(M_n) \to \pi_0^S$ is the zero map, and thus $\pi_1^S(M_n)$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of the degree 2 map on $\pi_1^S$. However, since $\pi_1^S \cong \Z/2\Z$, this map is the zero map, and thus $\pi_1^S(M_n) \cong \Z/2\Z$ as well.
