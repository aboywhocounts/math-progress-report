My name is Anthony Doll and I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student at UVA studying math. My main interests lie in algebraic topology, but I also have a soft spot for representation theory and anything that blends algebra, topology, and geometry together. I'm currently going through the grad school admissions cycle for PhD programs in math, so wish me luck!

Here is a copy of my CV:
