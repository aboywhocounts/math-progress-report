## The Statement

We begin with a fundamental result in representation theory.

::: {#thm-schur}
## Schur's Lemma
Let $V$ and $W$ be irreducible representations of a group $G$. 
If $\phi: V \to W$ is a $G$-module homomorphism, then:

1. Either $\phi$ is an isomorphism, or $\phi = 0$.
2. If $V = W$, then $\phi = \lambda I$ for some $\lambda \in \C$.

## The Proof
Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, its kernel is a subrepresentation of $V$...
